# 1.  There are some difference between list and a tuple. There are some examples:
# examples for list:
me = ['BMW', 'Toyota', 'Lexus', 'Mercedes','Opel', 'Lada']
examples for tupple: 
tuple = ('me','you','they','we')
# tupple is ordered and unchangeable

# 2. Difference between global and local variables:
# for example local x:
    # when we give value for x in case , when it is local:
x = 5
print(x)
#we can change the value for x every time and which value is the last it take it and print to console but when it is global it will be like:
global x
    x = 'UCA'
# 3. For loop and while loop are two major loop statments:
                # 1.for x in y
                # 2.while True:
# 4. string can be only text information and we cannot divede or multiply it with int 
Example: print("String" * 1 * "string") 
# 5. we can create function with def:
ex: def mySecondName():
    print('My name is Tabrez')

mySecondName()
# 6. we use boolean with logical function (True, False). If the condition is right print true and when it is wrong print False
# 7.Dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates and lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable
# 8. we can do it with .lower
example: me.lower
# 9. there are some ways to remove values from python list:
                # 1.name.remove("string")
                # 2.name.pop("number of string")
                # 3.name.pop() remove the last value
